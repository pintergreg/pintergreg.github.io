      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;abstract&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Public transport systems are vital for urban mobility, yet disparities in accessibility can contribute to social and economic inequalities. This study aims to evaluate the extent to which public transport accessibility influences inequality, with a particular focus on socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. By integrating geospatial analysis with socioeconomic data, this research seeks to identify disparities in transport accessibility and their broader implications.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Public transport is a crucial component of urban infrastructure, providing mobility to millions of people worldwide. However, accessibility to public transport varies significantly across different populations, leading to potential inequalities in access to employment, education, healthcare, and other essential services [1]. Understanding how these disparities manifest and their broader social implications is essential for informing policy and planning decisions aimed at promoting equitable urban mobility [2].&lt;/p&gt;</description>
