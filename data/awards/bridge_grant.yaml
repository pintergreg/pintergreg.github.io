    The Bridge Grants are a way for us to encourage young scientists to look for new scientific collaborations. We provide its awardees with financial support for a short external visit. More precisely, each application for a Bridge Grant must be submitted by two young researchers in complexity science. One of them is a receiving and the second a visiting candidate. The visiting candidate obtains the financial support to travel to the receiving candidate’s institution and work together on a project that addresses a problem in the field of complex systems.
