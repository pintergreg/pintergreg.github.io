AB: In this study, Call Detail Records (CDRs) covering Budapest for the month of June
  in 2016 were analyzed. During this observation period, the 2016 UEFA European Football
  Championship took place, which significantly affected the habit of the residents
  despite the fact that not a single match was played in the city. We evaluated the
  fans’ behavior in Budapest during and after the Hungarian matches and found that
  the mobile phone network activity reflected the football fans’ behavior, demonstrating
  the potential of the use of mobile phone network data in a social sensing system.
  The Call Detail Records were enriched with mobile phone properties and used to analyze
  the subscribers’ devices. Applying the device information (Type Allocation Code)
  obtained from the activity records, the Subscriber Identity Modules (SIM), which
  do not operate in cell phones, were omitted from mobility analyses, allowing us
  to focus on the behavior of people. Mobile phone price was proposed and evaluated
  as a socioeconomic indicator and the correlation between the phone price and the
  mobility customs was found. We also found that, besides the cell phone price, the
  subscriber age and subscription type also had effects on users’ mobility. On the
  other hand, these factors did not seem to affect their interest in football.
