abstract: |
    The analysis of human movement patterns based on mobile network data makes it
    possible to examine a very large population cost-effectively and has led to several
    discoveries about human dynamics. However, the application of this data source is
    still not common practice. The goal of this study was to analyze the commuting tendencies
    of the Budapest Metropolitan Area using mobile network data as a case study and
    propose an automatized alternative approach to the current, questionnaire-based
    method, as commuting is predominantly analyzed by the census, which is performed
    only once in a decade in Hungary. To analyze commuting, the home and work locations
    of cell phone subscribers were determined based on their appearances during and
    outside working hours. The detected home locations of the subscribers were compared
    to census data at a settlement level. Then, the settlement and district level commuting
    tendencies were identified and compared to the findings of census-based sociological
    studies. It was found that the commuting analysis based on mobile network data strongly
    correlated with the census-based findings, even though home and work locations were
    estimated by statistical methods. All the examined aspects, including commuting
    from sectors of the agglomeration to the districts of Budapest and the age-group-based
    distribution of the commuters, showed that mobile network data could be an automatized,
    fast, cost-effective, and relatively accurate way of analyzing commuting, that could
    provide a powerful tool for sociologists interested in commuting.
