    In this article, we explore the relationship between cellular phone data and housing
    prices in Budapest, Hungary. We determine mobility indicators from one months of
    Call Detail Records (CDR) data, while the property price data are used to characterize
    the socioeconomic status at the Capital of Hungary. First, we validated the proposed
    methodology by comparing the Home and Work locations estimation and the commuting
    patterns derived from the cellular network dataset with reports of the national
    mini census. We investigated the statistical relationships between mobile phone
    indicators, such as Radius of Gyration, the distance between Home and Work locations
    or the Entropy of visited cells, and measures of economic status based on housing
    prices. Our findings show that the mobility correlates significantly with the socioeconomic
    status. We performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on combined vectors of mobility
    indicators in order to characterize the dependence of mobility habits on socioeconomic
    status. The results of the PCA investigation showed remarkable correlation of housing
    prices and mobility customs.
