    Cities host diverse people and their mixing is the engine of prosperity. In turn,
    segregation and inequalities are common features of most cities and locations that
    enable the meeting of people with different socio-economic status are key for urban
    inclusion. In this study, we adopt the concept of economic complexity to quantify
    the sophistication of amenity supply at urban locations. We propose that neighborhood
    complexity and amenity complexity are connected to the ability of locations to attract
    diverse visitors from various socio-economic backgrounds across the city. We construct
    the measures of amenity complexity based on the local portfolio of diverse and non-ubiquitous
    amenities in Budapest, Hungary. Socio-economic mixing at visited third places is
    investigated by tracing the daily mobility of individuals and by characterizing
    their status by the real-estate price of their home locations. Results suggest that
    measures of ubiquity and diversity of amenities do not, but neighborhood complexity
    and amenity complexity are correlated with the urban centrality of locations. Urban
    centrality is a strong predictor of socio-economic mixing, but both neighborhood
    complexity and amenity complexity add further explanatory power to our models. Our
    work combines urban mobility data with economic complexity thinking to show that
    the diversity of non-ubiquitous amenities, central locations, and the potentials
    for socio-economic mixing are interrelated.
