abstract: |
    Advancement of accurate models for predicting real estate price is of utmost\
    \ importance for urban development and several critical economic functions. Due\
    \ to the significant uncertainties and dynamic variables, modeling real estate has\
    \ been studied as complex systems. In this study, a novel machine learning method\
    \ is proposed to tackle real estate modeling complexity. Call detail records (CDR)\
    \ provides excellent opportunities for in-depth investigation of the mobility characterization.\
    \ This study explores the CDR potential for predicting the real estate price with\
    \ the aid of artificial intelligence (AI). Several essential mobility entropy factors,\
    \ including dweller entropy, dweller gyration, workers\u2019 entropy, worker gyration,\
    \ dwellers\u2019 work distance, and workers\u2019 home distance, are used as input\
    \ variables. The prediction model is developed using the machine learning method\
    \ of multi-layered perceptron (MLP) trained with the evolutionary algorithm of particle\
    \ swarm optimization (PSO). Model performance is evaluated using mean square error\
    \ (MSE), sustainability index (SI), and Willmott\u2019s index (WI). The proposed\
    \ model showed promising results revealing that the workers\u2019 entropy and the\
    \ dwellers\u2019 work distances directly influence the real estate price. However,\
    \ the dweller gyration, dweller entropy, workers\u2019 gyration, and the workers\u2019\
    \ home had a minimum effect on the price. Furthermore, it is shown that the flow\
    \ of activities and entropy of mobility are often associated with the regions with\
    \ lower real estate prices.
