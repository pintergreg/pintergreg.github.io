abstract: |
    In this study, call detail records (CDR), covering Budapest, Hungary, are processed
    to analyze the circadian rhythm of the subscribers. An indicator, called wake-up
    time, is introduced to describe the behavior of a group of subscribers. It is defined
    as the time when the mobile phone activity of a group rises in the morning. Its
    counterpart is the time when the activity falls in the evening. Inhabitant and area-based
    aggregation are also presented. The former is to consider the people who live in
    an area, while the latter uses the transit activity in an area to describe the behavior
    of a part of the city. The opening hours of the malls and the nightlife of the party
    district are used to demonstrate this application as real-life examples. The proposed
    approach is also used to estimate the working hours of the workplaces. The findings
    are in a good agreement with the practice in Hungary, and also support the workplace
    detection method. A negative correlation is found between the wake-up time and mobility
    indicators (entropy, radius of gyration): on workdays, people wake up earlier and
    travel more, while on holidays, it is quite the contrary. The wake-up time is evaluated
    in different socioeconomic classes, using housing prices and mobile phones prices,
    as well. It is found that lower socioeconomic groups tend to wake up earlier.
