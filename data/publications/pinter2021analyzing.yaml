abstract: |
    In this study, Call Detail Records (CDRs) covering Budapest for the month of\
    \ June in 2016 were analyzed. During this observation period, the 2016 UEFA European\
    \ Football Championship took place, which significantly affected the habit of the\
    \ residents despite the fact that not a single match was played in the city. We\
    \ evaluated the fans\u2019 behavior in Budapest during and after the Hungarian matches\
    \ and found that the mobile phone network activity reflected the football fans\u2019\
    \ behavior, demonstrating the potential of the use of mobile phone network data\
    \ in a social sensing system. The Call Detail Records were enriched with mobile\
    \ phone properties and used to analyze the subscribers\u2019 devices. Applying the\
    \ device information (Type Allocation Code) obtained from the activity records,\
    \ the Subscriber Identity Modules (SIM), which do not operate in cell phones, were\
    \ omitted from mobility analyses, allowing us to focus on the behavior of people.\
    \ Mobile phone price was proposed and evaluated as a socioeconomic indicator and\
    \ the correlation between the phone price and the mobility customs was found. We\
    \ also found that, besides the cell phone price, the subscriber age and subscription\
    \ type also had effects on users\u2019 mobility. On the other hand, these factors\
    \ did not seem to affect their interest in football.
